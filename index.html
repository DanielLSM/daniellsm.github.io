		<p> I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/rpl"> RPL (Robotics, Perception and Learning)</a>, in the social robotics group at KTH, Stockholm.  My PhD advisor is Iolanda Leite.</p>
    <p> <b>Currently I am on a research visit at Yale University (from 04/2024), in the <a href="https://interactive-machines.gitlab.io/"> Interactive Machines Group</a>, under the guidance of Marynel Vazquez.</b></p>
		<p> I am a member of the <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/"> WASP</a> doctoral program from the Wallenberg foundation, which is the largest individual research program in Sweden.</p>
		<p> Previously I researched on combinatorial optimization using machine learning at TUDelft in the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/lr/organisatie/afdelingen/control-and-operations/air-transport-and-operations
      "> ATO (Air Transport and Operations) </a> department, Delft. I also did an internship at Latent Logic (acquired by <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a>), a self-driving car startup in Oxford. </p>

    <p>
      My research revolves around reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), with an emphasis on human-robot interaction applications.
