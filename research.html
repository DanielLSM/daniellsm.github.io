    <b> VARIQuery: VAE Segment-based Active Learning for Query Selection in Preference-based Reinforcement Learning </b>
    <p> <b>Daniel Marta*</b>, Simon Holk*, Christian Pek, Jana Tumova, and Iolanda Leite <br />
    IROS'23 </p>
  <p> This paper addresses the
    often-overlooked aspect of query selection, which is closely
    related to active learning (AL). We propose a novel query
    selection approach that leverages variational autoencoder (VAE)
    representations of state sequences. In this manner, we formulate
    queries that are diverse in nature while simultaneously taking
    into account reward model estimations.

      <b> Aligning Human Preferences with Baseline Objectives in Reinforcement Learning </b>
      <p> <b>Daniel Marta</b>, Simon Holk, Christian Pek, Jana Tumova, and Iolanda Leite <br />
      ICRA'23 </p>
    <p> By considering baseline objectives to be designed
      beforehand, we are able to narrow down the policy space, solely
      requesting human attention when their input matters the most.
      To allow for control over the optimization of different objectives,
      our approach contemplates a multi-objective setting. We achieve
      human-compliant policies by sequentially training an optimal
      policy from a baseline specification and collecting queries on
      pairs of trajectories.

        <b> Human-feedback shield synthesis for perceived safety in deep reinforcement learning </b>

        RAL'21 </p>
      <p> To obtain policies that are perceived
        as safe, we propose a shield synthesis framework with two
        distinct loops: (1) an inner loop that trains policies with a set
        of actions that is constrained by shields whose conservativeness
        is parameterized, and (2) an outer loop that presents example
        rollouts of the policy to humans and collects their feedback
        to update the parameters of the shields in the inner loop.

      <b> Human-Centric Autonomous Systems With LLMs for User Command Reasoning </b>
      <p> Yi Yang, Qingwen Zhang, Ci Li, <b>Daniel Marta</b>, Nazre Batool, John Folkesson <br />
    </p>
    <p> To ensure that the autonomous system
      meets the user’s intent, it is essential to accurately discern
      and interpret user commands, especially in complex or
      emergency situations. To this end, we propose to leverage
      the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
      (LLMs) to infer system requirements from in-cabin users’
      commands. Through a series of experiments that include
      different LLM models and prompt designs, we explore
      the few-shot multivariate binary classification accuracy
      of system requirements from natural language textual
      commands.
